  <heading>About me</heading>
  <p>
    I am an ambitious Syrian student currently pursuing a degree in Public
    Administration in Turkey, while self-studying programming and web
    development to expand my professional opportunities.<br />
    My goal is to bridge the gap between governance, technology, and business by
    combining academic knowledge with practical digital skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fluent in Arabic (native), English, and improving rapidly in Turkish, I have
    developed strong cross-cultural communication abilities. Alongside my
    studies,<br />
    I have built a foundation in Excel (formulas, macros, Power Query, BI) and
    programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter/Dart), with the determination to
    grow into full-stack development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I value critical thinking, self-discipline, and structured learning,
    constantly seeking to improve myself academically, technically, and
    personally.<br />
    With a strong interest in digital transformation, personal productivity, and
    problem-solving, I aim to achieve financial independence while becoming the
    best version of myself.
